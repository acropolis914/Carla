## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.2] - 2026-10-22

Patchbay focus and packaging release: the focused node title stays readable, cables react to focus immediately, and the AUR `clara-bin` package builds, installs and updates correctly.

### 2026-10-22 11:05:00
- **fix(ci)**: the published AUR `pkgrel` counter is no longer reset on every release
  - The release job copied `aur/clara-bin/PKGBUILD` verbatim and rewrote only `pkgver`, which reset the published AUR `pkgrel` back to the repository base value. The sync workflow derived the counter from the repository copy as well, so a second packaging change could not increment it past the already published value.
  - Both workflows now treat the AUR counter as the source of truth: it is kept when only the version changed, incremented when the PKGBUILD content changed, and never moves backwards. The sync workflow also never publishes a version whose release assets do not exist yet, so a packaging fix can no longer point users at a download that has not been released.

### 2026-10-20 05:55:00
- **fix(aur)**: `clara-bin` AUR package no longer fails to build
  - Users reported "Doesn't install on arch" for `clara-bin`. The upstream release asset (`clara-bin-<ver>-<rel>-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst`) is itself a pacman package and therefore carries pacman's own metadata files; the AUR `package()` step stripped `.PKGINFO` and `.MTREE` but left `.BUILDINFO` in the package root, so makepkg aborted with `ERROR: Dotfile found in package root` and no package was ever produced.
  - [aur/clara-bin/PKGBUILD](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/aur/clara-bin/PKGBUILD): `.BUILDINFO` is now excluded as well, so the AUR build completes and the resulting package installs and runs (`Clara v1.1.1`).
  - The same PKGBUILD derived the release asset name from `${pkgrel}`, but the release workflow always builds the Arch asset with `pkgrel=1`, so bumping the AUR `pkgrel` (as AUR requires when the PKGBUILD changes) made the download 404. The upstream release counter is now a separate `upstream_rel` variable.
  - The upstream release binaries are already stripped and carry no debug info, so makepkg's strip/debug pass only produced `No debugging symbols` warnings from `gdb-add-index` plus an empty `clara-bin-debug` split package. The PKGBUILD now uses `options=('!strip' '!debug')`, so the build is clean and only one package is produced.
  - Added [.github/workflows/aur-sync.yml](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/.github/workflows/aur-sync.yml), a manually triggered workflow that syncs the in-repo PKGBUILDs to the AUR repositories (bumping `pkgrel` when the PKGBUILD changes), so packaging fixes reach users without waiting for a full release cycle.

### 2026-10-20 05:30:00
- **fix(patchbay)**: focused node name no longer disappears, and cables react to focus immediately
  - Two issues reported from the Reddit release thread: "when a sink is focused, the sink's name disappears" and "manual linking is not automatically initiated until the chosen sink is moved to a new position".
  - [theme.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/patchcanvas/theme.py): the app-theme adaptation mapped the selected node title to `bg-primary` (the canvas background) while the title is drawn on the header background (`bg-surface`). On any dark palette those two are nearly identical shades, so the title vanished the moment the node was focused. The selected title now uses the accent color, and `parse_theme_dict()` runs a contrast pass on `box_text_sel` against the header background so the name stays readable on every theme.
  - [canvasbox.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/patchcanvas/canvasbox.py): `CanvasBox.itemChange()` now handles `ItemSelectedHasChanged` and calls the new `updateConnectionSelectionState()`, which refreshes the selection state of the attached cables. Focusing a node highlights and re-routes its cables immediately, instead of only after the node is dragged to a new position.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-10-20

Stability and reliability patch: Cardinal crash-on-load fix, Add Plugin view sync, persistent plugin cache, single startup recovery prompt, and a filetype-agnostic storage refactor.

### 2026-10-20 04:45:00
- **refactor(storage)**: program is now filetype-agnostic; only the save manager knows extensions
  - Project files, plugin state files and autosaves were recognized by hard-coded `.carxp`/`.carjp`/`.json`/`.carxs` string checks scattered across the host, widgets, session manager and rack list. The program now carries a filename plus an opaque format *tag*, and every extension/format decision lives in `ProjectStorageManager`.
  - [project_storage.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/project_storage.py): `ProjectStorageManager` is now registry-driven (`ProjectFormat` entries for XML project, JSON project, state). Added format-agnostic helpers `get_project_root()` (returns a common XML root for any project), `is_project_file()`, `is_state_file()`, `tag_from_filter()`, `ensure_extension()`, `open_filter()`/`save_filter()`, `sidecar_positions_path()`/`has_sidecar_positions()`. `is_project_file()` trusts primary extensions but only treats legacy `.json`/extension-less files as projects after content validation, so unrelated JSON on disk is never mistaken for a session. Legacy `*.json` stays loadable but is kept out of the file-dialog filters.
  - [carla_host.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_host.py): bridge pre-check, sidecar lookup, recent-projects, file tree double-click, NSM open and the open/save dialogs now route through the manager; save-as derives the extension from the selected filter tag instead of string matching.
  - [project_session.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/project_session.py): autosave discovery and JSON-vs-XML handling use `is_project_file()` and `prepare_for_backend_save()`.
  - [carla_widgets.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_widgets.py) / [racklistwidget.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/widgets/racklistwidget.py): plugin state dialogs and drag-drop project detection use the manager.

### 2026-10-20 04:15:00
- **fix(startup)**: single prompt for last-save/autosave recovery, loaded under the last-saved name and path
  - Startup could show two prompts back to back: a "Autosave Recovery Detected" `QMessageBox`, then the "Recent Session" offer dialog. These are now a single dialog: when a newer autosave exists the offer switches to a "Recover Session" presentation and the autosave content is loaded while the project keeps its last-saved name and path (`fProjectFilename`), so saving writes back to the real project.
  - [carla_widgets.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_widgets.py) `ProjectLoadingDialog`: added `recover_mode` and `offer_detail` options (title "Recover Session:", "Recover Session" button, custom detail text/height); non-offer usage unchanged.
  - [carla_host.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_host.py) `checkRecentOnStartup` no longer shows the separate recovery prompt; it passes the recovery info to the one dialog. `loadProjectNow` now records the actual loaded source so `projectLoadingFinished` restores canvas positions from the recovered autosave rather than the older project file.

### 2026-10-20 04:00:00
- **fix(pluginlist)**: cache every plugin format so a restart no longer needs a full rescan
  - The native discovery reports LV2 and internal plugins with a null `sha1` (`PluginDiscovery.cpp`), and both the scanner and dialog only wrote cache entries when a `sha1` existed. As a result LV2 (444) and internal (28) plugins were never cached and were re-enumerated on every launch, so the Add Plugin list looked incomplete until a manual refresh.
  - [startup_scanner.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/pluginlist/startup_scanner.py): added `_cacheKeyFor()` which falls back to a stable synthetic key derived from the plugin identity (`build|type|uniqueId|filename|label|name|maker`) when no `sha1` is available; the scanner now caches all formats and replaces (rather than appends to) an entry on first write per run, preventing duplicates for formats the native cache callback cannot skip.
  - Added a post-scan `_prunePluginCache()` pass that removes stale entries: synthetic entries whose plugin type was fully enumerated this run but not rewritten (plugin removed or identity changed), and sha1 entries whose filename now hashes differently (plugin updated). Formats skipped this run are left untouched to avoid wiping cache when a path is temporarily disabled.

### 2026-10-20 03:30:00
- **fix(pluginlist)**: Add Plugin dialog rack/cards no longer add the wrong plugin
  - The table auto-sorted itself with Qt (`sortByColumn`/`setSortingEnabled`) while the Rack and Cards lists stayed in insertion order. Every cross-view operation is keyed by row index, so once the table was sorted a rack/card row pointed at an unrelated plugin. The table now uses custom sorting (`_sortInfos`/`_onHeaderClicked`) that rebuilds all three views in the same order, restoring correct add, selection, favorite toggle, info panel and filtering.
  - [pluginlistdialog_py.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/pluginlist/pluginlistdialog_py.py): disabled Qt built-in table sorting, sort column/order is persisted via the header state, streamed scan results are appended in order and fully re-sorted when the scan finishes, and `_startScan(ignoreCache=True)` now clears the rack/cards lists too.

### 2026-10-20 03:00:00
- **fix(plugins)**: prevent the Cardinal VST3 crash (`X_GLXMakeCurrent` BadAccess + SIGSEGV) by sandboxing
  - Cardinal (VCV Rack) creates its own OpenGL/GLX context; when loaded in-process it collides with the host's GL context on the X server and takes Clara down. It is now auto-bridged when added, and included in the project-load bridge pre-check alongside KV-Element/JUCE.
  - [carla_host.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_host.py) `loadPluginFromData` forces `PLUGIN_OPTION_USE_BRIDGE` for Cardinal unless the user picked an explicit bridge mode; `loadProjectNow`'s collision pre-check now matches `cardinal` (and treats a missing `PreferPluginBridges` entry as "bridges off").

### 2026-10-19 23:45:00
- **docs**: refresh TODO.md and the README roadmap for shipped work; replace the last HTML dash entities

### 2026-10-19 23:30:00
- **docs**: replace long dashes (em/en) with standard hyphens across docs, comments, and CI output

### 2026-10-19 23:20:00
- **docs**: punctuation cleanup in the new README/CONTRIBUTING text

### 2026-10-19 23:10:00
- **docs**: add a "Why Clara?" section to the README
  - Explains Clara's frontend/QoL focus (patchbay ergonomics, OpenGL-driven animations, toggleable visuals) while crediting upstream Carla as the OG engine it builds upon.

### 2026-10-19 22:50:00
- **docs**: document the v1.1.0 CLI experience and the release version guard
  - [README.md](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/README.md) gained a "Modern CLI Experience" section covering the rich startup banner and the Ctrl+C prompt.
  - [installation.md](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/installation.md) AppImage/Flatpak examples bumped to 1.1.0 and the new launch/CLI behaviour documented.
  - [CONTRIBUTING.md](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/CONTRIBUTING.md) gained a "Release Process" section describing the tag/version consistency check, `scripts/check_version.sh`, and `scripts/release_and_push_aur.sh`.
  - [TODO.md](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/TODO.md) now tracks the finished CLI banner/SIGINT work.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-19

### 2026-10-19 22:20:00
- **feat(cli)**: rich startup banner and rich Ctrl+C prompt
  - Starting Clara from the CLI now prints a rich panel reading "Clara vX.Y.Z" then "based on Carla version A.B.C" (plus Python/Qt/PyQt/paths) instead of the plain `Carla ... started, status:` lines; `--version` uses the same banner. Falls back to plain text when `rich` is unavailable ([carla_shared.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_shared.py) `printStartupBanner`, called from [carla_host.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_host.py)).
  - The terminal SIGINT (Ctrl+C) prompt is now a rich panel: pressing `Enter` quits (default) and `T` keeps Clara running in the system tray, with a plain-text fallback.

### 2026-10-19 21:45:00
- **ci(release)**: enforce tag/version consistency and fix the AUR push on release
  - Added [check_version.sh](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/scripts/check_version.sh) which verifies a pushed `vX.Y.Z` tag matches `base_version` in [carla_shared.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_shared.py) and the `latest`/entry in [releases.json](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/releases.json); the AUR `pkgver` is checked as a warning since CI bumps it.
  - Added a `version-check` job to [package.yml](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/.github/workflows/package.yml) that gates `release`/`publish-aur` on tag pushes, and gave the release checkout `fetch-depth: 0` so `git push HEAD:main` fast-forwards instead of being rejected by the shallow clone.
  - The [pre-push hook](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/scripts/git-hooks/pre-push) now runs the version check on `v*` tag pushes and blocks a mismatched tag (override with `CLARA_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1`).
  - [release_and_push_aur.sh](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/scripts/release_and_push_aur.sh) now also bumps `base_version`, which had drifted and made packages self-report the wrong version to the in-app updater.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-10-19

### 2026-10-19 21:15:00
- **fix(version)**: bump the internal Clara version fallback to 1.0.5
  - `_get_clara_version()` in [carla_shared.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_shared.py) still returned `"1.0.3"` when no exact tag could be resolved (i.e. installed builds without a `.git` checkout, such as the AUR source tarball).
  - This drives `CLARA_VERSION_STRING`, which the About dialog, `setApplicationVersion`, and the update checker read, so a 1.0.4 package reported 1.0.3 and the updater kept re-offering the current release.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-10-19

### 2026-10-19 20:45:00
- **feat(plugins)**: choose bridge mode (in-process vs sandboxed) when adding a plugin
  - Added a "Mode:" selector in the plugin add dialog ([pluginlistdialog_py.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/pluginlist/pluginlistdialog_py.py)) with `Default`, `In-process (inline display)` and `Bridged (sandboxed)` choices, so a single plugin can opt out of (or into) the global bridge preference at add time.
  - Introduced `PLUGIN_OPTION_USE_BRIDGE` (`0x800`) and `PLUGIN_OPTION_AVOID_BRIDGE` (`0x1000`) in [CarlaBackend.h](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/backend/CarlaBackend.h) and [carla_backend.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_backend.py), honored per-plugin in [CarlaEngine.cpp](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/backend/engine/CarlaEngine.cpp) on top of the global `PreferPluginBridges` option.
  - The choice is persisted with the plugin in the project `<Options>` value and re-applied on load and clone, so in-process plugins keep rendering their inline displays in the patchbay while sandboxed plugins stay bridged.

### 2026-10-19 19:30:00
- **feat(settings)**: expose plugin-bridge controls in the data-driven settings UI
  - Added a "Plugin Sandboxing & Bridges" set of controls to [settings_schema.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/settings_schema.py): an "Enable plugin bridges (experimental)" master checkbox (`Experimental/PluginBridges`) and a "Run plugins in bridge mode when possible" checkbox (`Engine/PreferPluginBridges`), restoring the control that was missing from the schema-driven Experimental tab.
  - The bridge-mode checkbox depends on the master toggle and includes a tooltip noting that bridged plugins cannot show inline displays and that an engine restart is required.

### 2026-10-19 18:50:00
- **fix(patchbay)**: restore inline display rendering and dimensions for VU meters inside node boxes
  - Fixed configuration scope in [carla_settings.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_settings.py) by targeting `QSafeSettings("falkTX", "Carla2")` so `Canvas/InlineDisplays` properly persists and synchronizes to `patchcanvas.options.inline_displays`.
  - Accounted for node header and rack subbar heights in [canvasbox.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/patchcanvas/canvasbox.py), ensuring embedded plugin inline displays (like Big Meter and LV2 utilities) reserve sufficient canvas box dimensions and align properly beneath toolbar controls.

### 2026-10-19 17:36:00
- **fix(ui)**: restore search field and filter visibility across all view modes
  - Fixed search and filter regression in [pluginlistdialog_py.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/pluginlist/pluginlistdialog_py.py) where rows passing filter checks were accidentally not unhidden due to an omitted `_showRow(i)` call.
  - Re-synchronized `_hideRow` and `_showRow` to update Table, Rack, and Cards rows consistently without desync when filtering.
  - Completely removed the 12ms background streaming timer that was forcing thousands of complex `CardPluginItemWidget` QFrames to be allocated in RAM.
  - Replaced bulk card allocation with pure on-demand viewport rendering via `viewport().indexAt(QPoint(...))` so only currently visible cards on screen are ever created.
  - Restricted widget creation and `updatesEnabled` toggling exclusively to the active view mode (Rack or Cards) rather than populating and hiding all three views in parallel.
  - Added on-demand view visibility synchronization `_syncViewModeVisibility()` when toggling view modes, avoiding redundant hidden-state loops during search and filter operations.
  - Fixed `TypeError: cannot use 'PyQt6.QtWidgets.QListWidgetItem' as a set element` in [pluginlistdialog_py.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/pluginlist/pluginlistdialog_py.py) by iterating selection lists directly.
  - Fixed exponential path list duplication bug in [carla_settings.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_settings.py) by clearing `lw_*` list widgets before loading and deduplicating stored paths.
  - Fixed duplicate plugin streaming in [pluginlistdialog_py.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/pluginlist/pluginlistdialog_py.py) by returning `False` on duplicate in `_pluginsAdd()`, preventing duplicate table rows from being added.
  - Added discovery stage logging and imported `log_carla` in [startup_scanner.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/pluginlist/startup_scanner.py).
  - Fixed missing `QTimer` import in [carla_settings.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_settings.py).

### 2026-10-19 17:28:00
- **fix(ui)**: transparent plugin card text backgrounds and debounced live theme switching in settings
  - Enforced `background: transparent` and `setAutoFillBackground(False)` on all text labels within `CardPluginItemWidget` in [pluginlistdialog_py.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/pluginlist/pluginlistdialog_py.py) and [base_primitives.qss](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/styles/base_primitives.qss), eliminating opaque rectangular background boxes on plugin cards.
  - Added a 120ms single-shot timer debounce to live theme selection in [carla_settings.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_settings.py), decoupling rapid combobox navigation from blocking whole-app stylesheet re-evaluations and icon re-rendering.

### 2026-10-19 17:10:00
- **fix(styles)**: eliminate opaque text background blocks in rack slots for clean color tinting
  - Enforced `background: transparent` across all rack item text labels, title stacks, and sub-containers in [carla_skin.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_skin.py) and [base_primitives.qss](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/styles/base_primitives.qss).
  - Disabled `autoFillBackground` on rack slot title and badge labels so custom category color tints render cleanly and flatly without opaque rectangular seams.

### 2026-10-19 14:50:00
- **fix(styles)**: achieve end-to-end theme compliance across rack slots, patchbay canvas background, typography, and pills
  - Fixed typography clipping across rack slots and controls by setting `font-family: inherit` in [engine.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/styles/engine.py), honoring system font metrics and optical font advances.
  - Bound [carla_skin.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_skin.py) rack items to active theme tokens via `get_active_skin_palette()`, preserving custom color tinting while synchronizing background, text, sliders, and borders with the chosen theme.
  - Linked [patchcanvas/theme.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/patchcanvas/theme.py) to active engine tokens (`bg-primary`, `bg-surface`, `accent`, `border-dim`), harmonizing the canvas background color with the application theme.
  - Upgraded filter sidebar pills in [pluginlistdialog_py.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/pluginlist/pluginlistdialog_py.py) to dynamically bind to `--accent`, `--bg-surface`, `--border-dim`, and `--text-secondary`.

### 2026-10-19 14:37:00
- **fix(settings)**: resolve groupbox title overlaps and synchronize sidebar icon colors with active theme
  - Re-anchored `QGroupBox` and `QGroupBox::title` styles with `subcontrol-origin: margin`, `margin-top: 14px`, and proper padding in [base_primitives.qss](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/styles/base_primitives.qss), eliminating chopped titles and overlapping widget content.
  - Linked `_make_glyph_icon` directly to the active theme engine accent token with fallback to `QPalette.Highlight`, and added `_update_sidebar_icons()` on theme switching in [carla_settings.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/carla_settings.py).

### 2026-10-19 14:24:00
- **feat(styles)**: centralize theming engine with Base16/Base24 ingestion, auto light/dark flip, and unified UI primitives
  - Implemented deterministic cascade pipeline in [engine.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/styles/engine.py): `System Core Defaults` -> `Semantic Variable Map` -> `Active Theme Overrides (Palette)` -> `Mode Inversion (Light/Dark)` -> `Component Primitives`.
  - Built comprehensive root baseline [base_primitives.qss](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/styles/base_primitives.qss) binding variables to headers, buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-subtle`, `.btn-danger`), pills/badges (`.pill`), form inputs, cards, rack items, tables, and minimal scrollbars.
  - Implemented direct Base16/Base24 palette ingestion and automatic grayscale scale flipping (`base00`-`base07`) for instantaneous light/dark modes without altering accent colors.
  - Consolidated theme definitions into a centralized registry [registry.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/styles/registry.py) bundled with lean Base16 palettes (Catppuccin Macchiato, Mocha, Latte, Classic Dark, Nord, Tokyo Night, Dracula, Gruvbox Dark) and dynamic YAML/JSON ingestion.
  - Integrated [ThemeEngine](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/styles/engine.py) into [ThemeManager](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/styles/theme_manager.py) and added verification demo [demo_theme_verification.py](file:///home/acroarch/Documents/Projects/git-clones/Carla/source/frontend/styles/demo_theme_verification.py).

### 2026-10-19 14:16:00
- **feat(pluginlist)**: achieve 1:1 visual parity with generative UI redesign
  - Upgraded `QFrame#rackPluginItem` to 10px rounded capsule aesthetics, increased spacing, and polished category accent indicator bars.
  - Upgraded `QFrame#cardPluginItem` to 12px rounded cards with 10px top accent strips, subtle horizontal divider lines, developer subtitle coloring, and proper pill margins.
  - Replaced native OS checkbox with crisp golden text stars (`★` / `☆`) in `QTableWidget` favorite column.
  - Added transparent item selection background stylesheets to `pluginRackListWidget` and `pluginCardsListWidget` to eliminate Qt's native selection overlay fringe and allow custom card borders to shine.
  - Styled `QTableWidget` rows with subtle bottom borders, 30px height, and refined selection highlights across all 4 themes.
- **fix(pluginlist)**: eliminate required scroll to render cards/rack items and colorize format badges
  - Fixed issue where the user had to scroll first before cards or rack items visually appeared by adding `_ensureVisibleWidgets()` to eagerly instantiate the active viewport batch on `showEvent`, filter changes, and view mode switching.
  - Replaced fallback `indexAt()` scroll detection with direct scrollbar offset calculation (`sb.value() // rowHeight`), ensuring rock-solid row range coverage during fast or fractional scrolling.
  - Enhanced `RackPluginItemWidget` and `CardPluginItemWidget` with distinct format pill colors (CLAP, VST3, LV2, VST2, JSFX), custom amber favorite stars, and set default table row height to 30px for better vertical rhythm.
- **feat(pluginlist)**: optimize dialog cold start to ~50ms, modernize cards and rack items, and style table headers
  - Implemented on-demand lazy/streaming instantiation for Rack and Card item widgets, reducing cold-start modal freeze from ~1,529ms to ~50ms (>30x speedup) across 800+ plugins.
  - Added background chunk streaming timer and scroll event hooks (`_onRackScroll`, `_onCardsScroll`) to populate visible viewport rows smoothly on demand.
  - Modernized `CardPluginItemWidget` geometry (190x115px, `border-radius: 8px`), top 4px category accent color strip with rounded corners, formatted I/O labels (`Stereo`, `Mono`, `MIDI`), and pointing hand cursor on favorite stars.
  - Modernized `RackPluginItemWidget` with category accent indicator, clean typography hierarchy, and selection highlight states.
  - Added dedicated styling for `QHeaderView`, `QHeaderView::section`, and `QTableCornerButton::section` across all four QSS themes (`catppuccin_macchiato.qss`, `catppuccin_mocha.qss`, `catppuccin_latte.qss`, `classic_dark.qss`).
- **feat(pluginlist)**: simplify reset filters button, combine view modes into single toggle, and split rescan into two buttons
  - Simplified the Reset Filters button into a flat, compact action with subtle styling and clean 16px icon.
  - Converted the 3-button segmented Rack/Cards/Table switcher into a single cycling toggle button (`btnViewMode`) displaying the active mode glyph and title (`☲ Rack`, `▦ Cards`, `☰ Table`).
  - Separated the rescan toolbutton popup into two explicit push buttons: `Rescan` (quick incremental scan) and `Full Rescan` (complete cache-busting discovery).

### 2026-10-19 13:32:00
- **fix(pluginlist)**: harmonize pill filter button geometry and rounded capsule border radii
  - Fixed distorted dimensions and square corners on selected filter pills by synchronizing `border-radius: 12px`, `padding: 2px 9px`, `min-height: 20px`, and `max-height: 20px` across both normal and `:checked` states in `filterSidebar` and all 4 QSS themes.

- **fix(settings)**: import missing `QApplication` and `QPalette` in `carla_settings.py`
  - Resolved `NameError: name 'QApplication' is not defined` when opening the Carla Settings dialog (`slot_configureCarla`).

### 2026-10-19 06:47:00
- **fix(ui)**: complete 4-theme QSS parity, style plugin browser presentation modes, and fix selection collisions
  - Achieved 100% selector parity across all 4 themes (`catppuccin_latte.qss`, `classic_dark.qss`, `catppuccin_macchiato.qss`, `catppuccin_mocha.qss`), adding complete styling for checkboxes, radio buttons, combo box popups, text edits, sliders, tab bars, and item views.
  - Resolved objectName collision on `list_rack` in Add Plugin dialog (`pluginRackListWidget`), ensuring items render with proper card background, borders, and hover/selection highlights instead of host rack transparent defaults.
  - Enclosed `Rack`, `Cards`, and `Table` view mode buttons into a segmented container frame (`#viewModeContainer`) matching the prototype UI.
  - Added dynamic item-level selection updates for `RackPluginItemWidget` and `CardPluginItemWidget` (`[selected="true"]`).

- **feat(ui)**: minimal system-framed loading dialog with live plugin and routing status
  - Restored clean native OS window framing to ensure 100% compatibility across all Linux/Wayland/X11 window managers without translucent background artifacts.
  - Streamlined layout to a minimal, compact dialog showing project filename, live completion percentage, and active gradient progress bar.
  - Added specific live loading status updates: detailed plugin names with format tags (e.g. `Surge XT [LV2]`, `Dexed [VST3]`) and audio/MIDI graph routing progress.
  - Kept smooth auto-advancing progress ticker to prevent progress bar freezing during blocking plugin DSOs.
  - Updated Generative UI preview widget to reflect the system-framed minimal style.

### 2026-10-19 04:15:00
- **perf(settings)**: lazy tab building and dialog caching for fast cold start and instant reopen
  - Deferred declarative schema construction for Patchbay, OSC, Wine, and Experimental tabs until explicitly visited, avoiding construction of ~100 widgets on dialog open.
  - Implemented background idle pre-warming (`_prewarmSettingsDialog` via `QTimer.singleShot(400)`) so the dialog is constructed asynchronously before first user interaction, reducing first-click latency from ~150ms to ~0.3ms.
  - Cached `_settingsDialog` on `HostWindow` to eliminate repeated widget instantiation on subsequent settings opens.
  - Moved `getBestNerdFont` to `carla_shared` with set lookup and cached glyph icon rasterization (`_GLYPH_ICON_CACHE`), decoupling settings from canvas imports and preventing FreeType glyph render warnings.
  - Cached discovered theme listings in `ThemeManager` to eliminate repetitive filesystem disk queries.

### 2026-10-19 04:00:00
- **perf(gui)**: visibility culling, OpenGL hardware acceleration, and meter deadband throttling
  - Enabled hardware-accelerated `QOpenGLWidget` viewport on `RackListWidget` to offload rack rasterization from CPU to GPU.

  - Forwarded mouse wheel scrolling over parameter labels, backgrounds, and whitespace to the active plugin parameter `QScrollArea` instead of scrolling the outer rack.
  - Preserved independent mouse wheel control directly on sliders and spinboxes while removing outer-card wheel hijacking.

### 2026-10-19 02:35:00
- **fix(rack)**: dynamic 5-character minimum width and frameless spinbox line edits
  - Calculated font-metrics-based 5-character minimum width (`"00000"`) and applied it dynamically to both `QDoubleSpinBox` and its inner `QLineEdit`.
  - Set `setFrame(False)` on `QDoubleSpinBox` to strip native frame overhead and removed rigid fixed-width constraints.

### 2026-10-19 02:27:00
- **fix(rack)**: clean borderless parameter readouts and minimum slider travel width
  - Removed borders, outlines, and box backgrounds from `QDoubleSpinBox` for clean, modern DAW-style value text with subtle hover highlight.
  - Expanded value text box width (56px inline, 62px stacked) and height (20px) to eliminate horizontal and vertical digit clipping on multi-digit and decimal values.
  - Enforced 80px minimum width (`setMinimumWidth(80)`) on horizontal parameter sliders to prevent excessive compression.

### 2026-10-19 02:20:00
- **fix(rack)**: compact slider textboxes and dynamic responsive slider card reflow
  - Implemented dynamic `setIsMini` layout switching on `SliderParamWidget` between inline (1-row) and stacked (2-row) card views with `QGridLayout`.
  - In ultra-thin viewports (< 320px), stacked mode gives the horizontal slider 100% full width of the card and places the label and spinbox cleanly on row 1.
  - Compacted `QDoubleSpinBox` dimensions (height 18px, width 40-44px), eliminated hidden subcontrol buttons and internal `QLineEdit` padding, ensuring numerical text is completely readable and unclipped.
  - Dynamically tightened `sliders_layout` margins and spacing in ultra-thin viewports (< 260px).

### 2026-10-19 02:10:00
- **fix(rack)**: isolate knob wheel scrolling and compact responsive knob sizing
  - Implemented `wheelEvent` handling on `CommonDial` and `SliderParamWidget` with event acceptance to directly adjust values without bubbling to the rack list.
  - Intercepted mouse wheel events in `RackListWidget.wheelEvent` over dials, sliders, spinboxes, and comboboxes to prevent rack viewport jumping.
  - Added text elision to `CommonDial.paintEvent` to prevent dial label clipping and overflow in narrow columns.
  - Dynamically scaled dial size (from 58×50px down to 46×44px in `< 260px`) and reduced spacing/margins in `_reflowResponsiveLayout`.
  - Automatically hid secondary right knob column (Dry/Wet/Volume) below 320px width to grant primary plugin controls full breathing room.

### 2026-10-19 01:55:00
- **fix(rack)**: complete 100% visual parity with responsive rack prototype
  - Re-implemented `LEDButton._paintMinimalLed` to paint crisp 1:1 square pixel tiles with specular edge highlights instead of round ellipses.

  - Updated power and bypass button state stylesheets to emerald green (`#a6e3a1`) and warm amber (`#fab387`).
  - Swapped washed-out legacy 40-50 RGB category colors with vibrant Catppuccin accents for the left rack slot stripe and subtitle.

### 2026-10-19 01:45:00
- **feat(rack)**: unified dynamic adaptive rack slot layout and specification manifest
  - Authored comprehensive specification and parity checklist in `docs/DYNAMIC_RACK_SPEC.md` defining 3 responsive width tiers (Ultra-Thin `< 230px`, Medium `230px-440px`, Wide `≥ 440px`).
  - Decommissioned rigid "Mini Rack Mode" global setting and per-plugin layer toggles in favor of automatic responsive reflow.
  - Implemented universal title double-click to toggle rack slot expansion/collapse across all viewport widths.
  - Enforced strictly square 18×18px 2×2 I/O LED grid with 8×8 square pixel tiles and 18px vertical peak meters.
  - Added stacked parameter card layout (label/value on row 1, 100% width slider on row 2) for narrow sidebars `< 320px` to guarantee full scrub travel and prevent label clipping.
  - Guaranteed 150px+ dedicated breathing room for plugin title in medium viewport by retaining presets on subrow.

### 2026-10-19 01:15:00
- **fix(shortcuts)**: resolve ambiguous `Ctrl+S` and `Ctrl+Shift+S` shortcut overload
  - Removed duplicate `QShortcut` instances that conflicted with window-level `ui.act_file_save` and `ui.act_file_save_as` actions.
  - Set `ApplicationShortcut` context across save, save-as, open, and new actions for seamless window-wide triggering.

### 2026-10-19 01:10:00
- **feat(rack)**: 2-line minified layer layout and scrollable mini parameter drawer
  - Separated slot controls into a clean 2-line flex layout: Row 1 handles power/bypass/type/title and disclosure chevron; Row 2 houses preset selector and LEDs/peak meters to eliminate horizontal widget overlap.
  - Wrapped mini parameter tray in a `QScrollArea` with `MINIMAL_SCROLLBAR_QSS` and standardized label/spinbox column widths (75px/46px), preventing clipping when plugins have many parameters.
  - Adjusted collapsed and expanded slot heights with dynamic scroll handling.

### 2026-10-19 01:05:00
- **fix(patchbay)**: preserve readable text contrast on selected canvasbox nodes
  - Ensured custom tinted headers calculate contrast based on background luminescence rather than being overwritten with inverted/unreadable selection text colors.
  - Safely fell back to standard readable box text when selected text color is unset.

### 2026-10-19 00:50:00
- **feat(rack)**: global mini rack mode setting, unified disclosure button, and cleaned parameter slider layout
  - Added global "Use minified layer view for rack slots by default" setting (`Main/MiniRackMode`) in the Settings dialog Appearance section.
  - Unified the duplicate arrow down / expand button into a single contextual disclosure chevron (`▸`/`▾`/`▴`) that controls both slot collapsing and mini parameter drawer disclosure.
  - Optimized mini parameter sliders spacing, margins, and row height (18px) to stack cleanly without crowding or label overlap.

### 2026-10-19 00:40:00
- **fix(rack)**: fix `get_custom_data_value` method call in `createPluginSlot`
  - Fixed `host.get_custom_data` call which expected a numeric index instead of type and key, causing a traceback when creating plugin slots.

### 2026-10-19 00:15:00
- **feat(rack)**: Photoshop-layer style minified rack view with collapsible mini parameter sliders
  - Introduced minified "Layer View" in `PluginSlot_Minimal` rendering plugins as ultra-compact 36px strips with left-aligned power, bypass, type badge, and title.
  - Added collapsible mini parameters drawer (`w_mini_params_tray`) with disclosure chevron (`▸`/`▾`), exposing essential controls in 18px horizontal mini sliders.
  - Cleaned up layout hierarchy and parenting so toggling between Knobs, Sliders, and Minified Layer views is instantaneous without re-allocating widgets.
  - Added "Minified Layer View" toggle to slot context menu (`slot_showCustomMenu`) and preserved state in plugin custom data (`CarlaSkinLayerMode`).

### 2026-10-18 23:28:00
- **refactor(version)**: centralize Clara version as single source of truth and deprecate unused C++ dialogs
  - Established `carla_shared.py:CLARA_VERSION_STRING` as the single source of truth for Clara versioning with dynamic fallback to git tags.
  - Updated `carla_app.py` to register `CLARA_VERSION_STRING` in `QCoreApplication.setApplicationVersion`.
  - Updated `aboutdialog_py.py` to dynamically display the active Clara version alongside the Carla basis version.
  - Marked superseded legacy C++ dialog files (`aboutdialog.cpp`, `aboutdialog.hpp`, `jackappdialog.cpp`, `jackappdialog.hpp`) as deprecated.

### 2026-10-18 08:38:00
- **fix(shortcuts)**: restore `Ctrl+S` and `Ctrl+Shift+S` save functionality across all focus contexts
  - Fixed missing `QShortcut` and `QKeySequence` import in `carla_host.py`.
  - Registered window-level actions and dedicated `QShortcut` bindings with `Qt.ApplicationShortcut` context so saving triggers even when the menubar is hidden (Modern UI Mode / `Ctrl+M`).
  - Added `Qt.ShortcutContext` compatibility aliases in `qt_compat.py` for PyQt6.
  - Kept project save and open actions active during startup and engine stopped states instead of disabling them.
  - Added `Ctrl+S` / `Ctrl+Shift+S` event interception in `DraggableGraphicsView`, `QGraphicsScene`, and `RackListWidget` to prevent canvas/rack focus from swallowing save events.

### 2026-10-18 08:18:00
- **fix(ui)**: resolve `Qt.WaitCursor` PyQt6 compatibility alias
  - Added `WaitCursor`, `BusyCursor`, `IBeamCursor`, and `ForbiddenCursor` to `qt_compat.py` `Qt.CursorShape` compatibility aliases for PyQt6.
  - Added safe attribute fallback for cursor overrides in `carla_host.py:loadPluginFromData`.

### 2026-10-18 04:40:00
- **feat(plugins)**: non-blocking startup scanner, inline live-streaming refresh, and persistent multi-add loading

### 2026-10-18 04:00:00
- **chore**: synchronize version string to 1.0.3 and ignore local PKGBUILD artifacts

### 2026-10-18 00:50:00
- **feat(theme)**: live system theme adaptation, canvasbox synchronization, and color likeliness matching
  - Implemented `find_closest_system_color` with 75% perceptual likeliness threshold matching and tone adjustment against `QApplication.palette()`.
  - Enabled live seamless toggle of "Use system desktop theme" without application restart, updating the patchbay canvas, canvasboxes, rack background, and top banners in real time.
  - Dynamically synchronized patchbay canvas, canvasbox node headers/bodies, port text, and selection rubberbands to the system palette when system theme is active.
  - Updated rack list widget viewport and top notification/support banners to dynamically adapt to system palette roles.

### 2026-10-18 00:30:00
- **feat(theme)**: Catppuccin Macchiato default, roundedness, minimal scrollbars, and full QSS data-driven styling
  - Set `Catppuccin Macchiato` as default theme for application interface and patchbay canvas.
  - Added modern 6-8px component roundedness and minimal 8px scrollbars with subtle track and contrast hover handles across all themes.
  - Extracted hardcoded inline stylesheets from Python files into theme stylesheets (`catppuccin_macchiato.qss`, `catppuccin_mocha.qss`, `catppuccin_latte.qss`, `classic_dark.qss`) targeting semantic IDs (`#miniCanvasFloatFrame`, `#canvasNodeSearchList`, `#rackListWidget`, `#rackFloatingAddButton`, `#canvasSearchEdit`).

### 2026-10-17 15:40:00
- **feat(ui)**: data-driven QSS theming engine and theme selector
  - Added `styles/theme_manager.py` discovering and hot-reloading `.qss` theme files dynamically from disk (`source/frontend/styles/themes/` and `~/.config/clara/themes/`).
  - Added Catppuccin Mocha, Catppuccin Latte (Light), and Classic Dark stylesheets.
  - Replaced legacy Pro Theme with `Use system desktop theme` toggle and dynamic `Application theme` selector in Settings > General with live styling updates.
  - Preserved canvasbox and patchbay node/cable theme isolation (`patchcanvas/themes.json`).
- **fix(ci)**: robust version fallback and Fedora RPM version formatting
  - Fall back to numeric tag/version when triggered on branches so `dpkg-deb` and `rpmbuild` do not fail on non-digit branch names.
  - Convert hyphens to dots in RPM `Version:` field to satisfy RPM specification constraints.
- **fix(build)**: install `styles` directory and themes in Makefile
  - Include `styles/` and `styles/themes/*.qss` in `make install` and resource linking so packaged installations find `styles.theme_manager`.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-10-17

### 2026-10-17 11:15:00
- **feat(canvas)**: peak-hold pulse smoothing and gradient-tinted signal flow
  - `pwlevels.py`: implemented 150ms peak-hold buffer with exponential decay (`0.85 ** ((dt - 0.15) / 0.04)`) to eliminate rapid signal flickering and dropouts during transient audio.
  - `canvasline.py`: interpolated RGB colors between source and destination nodes along path parameter `t` (`_interp_color(t)`), rendering cable traveling comets with full source-to-destination gradient tinting.

### 2026-10-17 05:58:00
- **fix(rack)**: eliminate rack width blinking and defocus position jumping
  - Guard `updateRackItemSize()` in `AbstractPluginSlot.resizeEvent` to only trigger when height changes, breaking the re-layout loop between slot frames and `QListWidget`.
  - Maintain symmetric splitter resizing and enforce container `minimumWidth` so Hyprland border adjustments on focus/defocus don't shift the rack rightward.
  - Make statusbar indicators and combo boxes flexible with `QSizePolicy.Ignored` / `Minimum` so the window minimum width drops from 824px to 420px, allowing half-screen tiling without layout clipping.

### 2026-10-17 05:32:00
- **feat(settings)**: declarative schema overhaul with responsive 2-column layout and UI refinements
  - Reconstructed settings tabs (**General**, **Patchbay**, **OSC**, **Wine**, **Experimental**) using data-driven schemas (`settings_schema.py`) and `SettingsFormBuilder`.
  - Fixed sidebar tab label truncation by widening the sidebar navigation table and inheriting the default system UI typography.
  - Eliminated legacy dead whitespace by top-aligning form containers directly at the layout root.

### 2026-10-17 03:25:00
- **feat(canvas)**: Clara 1.0.2 - OpenGL-first canvas rendering and uninterrupted signal flow
  - Default `UseOpenGL` to `true` (with fallback only if Qt reports OpenGL unsupported), ensuring hardware acceleration handles canvas box drop shadows, cable glow, and 25 FPS signal-flow pulses fluidly without artificial software-render throttle profiles.
  - `pwlevels.py`: resolved ctypes `c_void_p` callback pointer unwrap in `_on_stream_read`, allowing PipeWire and PulseAudio audio peaks to reliably drive node pulsing and cable travelling comets; added normalized name matching for audio sources.
  - `carla_logger.py`: rate-limit terminal output to 60 lines/sec when attached to a TTY and only mirror logs when `sys.stdout.isatty()`.
  - `carla_host.py`: batched log flushes every 100ms and capped log buffer at 5000 lines to prevent UI thread lockups under high-frequency backend logging; respect `ModernUiMode` at startup and default to hiding the side panel and meters in modern mode.
  - `carla_canvas.py` & `carla_host.py`: anchored floating canvas mode palette, context toolbar, and minimap to the patchbay container frame so they remain consistently positioned regardless of canvas pan/zoom/resize.
  - `carla_settings.py`: prevented normal settings save from resetting experimental and OpenGL selections, and exposed "Fancy eye-candy" directly in the Canvas tab.

### 2026-10-16 21:32:00
- **fix(frontend)**: modern UI hides the side panel by default, and the canvas toolbars no longer drift
  - Side panel: in Modern UI mode the left sidebar is now off at startup; a stale `ShowSidePanel=true` written by classic-era defaults no longer overrides the modern layout. Enabling Modern UI from Settings also closes the sidebar immediately. Classic mode still defaults to the panel shown.
  - `carla_host.py`: `loadSettings` defaults `ShowSidePanel` to `not modernUi` and forces it off while modern is active; `slot_toggleModernUi` hides the side panel when modern is switched on.
  - Canvas toolbars & minimap: the floating left mode palette, the top context toolbar and the floating minimap were parented to the patchbay viewport and re-centred on every resize; they are now anchored to the patchbay container (the graphics view's parent), pinned to the container's top-left, top-right and bottom-right respectively, so panning, zooming, splitter moves and window resizes keep them in place.
  - `carla_canvas.py`: `CanvasViewportFilter` reparents both overlays to the graphics view's parent; `CanvasToolBarOverlay.reposition`/`CanvasContextToolBarOverlay.reposition` pin to fixed top-left/top-right corners.
  - `carla_host.py`: `_ensureMiniCanvasOverlay`/`_ensureMiniCanvasRestoreButton` reparent the minimap overlay and its restore "Map" button to the patchbay container; `_repositionMiniCanvasFloat` pins them to the container's bottom-right.

### 2026-10-16 21:05:00
- **fix(frontend)**: Modern UI setting is honored at startup
  - `ModernUiMode=true` configs that also had a stale `SideBySideEnabled=false` started classic while Settings > Modern UI stayed checked; only retoggling applied the modern view. Two causes: (1) `loadSettings(True)` runs before the side-by-side action exists, so the modern mode was only restored into the checkbox and never applied; (2) `saveSettings` derived `SideBySideEnabled` from "is the split tab the currently selected tab", which saved `false` whenever another tab was focused on close.
  - `carla_host.py`: save now uses the side-by-side action's checked state; both restore paths treat Modern UI as the master switch (modern on ⇒ side-by-side applied regardless of a stale saved `false`).

### 2026-10-16 20:47:00
- **fix(frontend)**: backend log floods no longer freeze the UI
  - The C++ backend floods the debug callback (JACK `nframes == bufferSize` assertion loop, PipeWire/PulseAudio port add/remove churn). Every line was rendered with `rich` for the terminal (`console_enabled` hardcoded `True`, even with no tty attached) and appended one line at a time to the log `QPlainTextEdit`, each call re-laying-out the whole document. Under flood this consumed ~82% of CPU in the logging pipeline (`_print_terminal` 46.5% + `print` 21.8% + `slot_onLogAdded` 21.2%), pegging the GUI thread at ~96% and freezing the app.
  - `carla_logger.py`: console mirroring now defaults to `sys.stdout.isatty()` so GUI launches skip `rich` rendering entirely; terminal output is rate-limited to 60 lines/sec with a `[console throttled: N lines suppressed]` summary.
  - `carla_host.py`: log lines are batched and flushed once per 100 ms instead of one widget re-layout per line; the log widget is capped at 5000 blocks.
  - Verified with py-spy: CPU drops from ~96% to ~10% (now dominated by normal Qt event-loop + refresh timers), UI stays responsive on the software-raster viewport.

### 2026-10-16 06:10:00
- **perf(canvas)**: automatic software-render performance profile for the patchbay
  - Fresh configs default to `UseOpenGL=false`, which put the patchbay on the software raster path where the fork's eye candy makes it unusable. `setupCanvas` now detects the actual viewport type and sets `patchcanvas.options.software_render`; on that path the canvas drops effects that are GPU-cheap but CPU-brutal: box drop-shadow effects (`canvasbox.py`), the cosmetic cable glow overlay (`canvasline.py`), the animated signal-flow pulse (~25 FPS repaint of every active cable, `carla_canvas.py`), and minimap re-renders (whole-scene second pass, `carla_host.py`). GL users are unaffected.

### 2026-10-16 05:20:00
  - New `publish-aur` job in `package.yml` (runs after `release` on `v*` tags): sets up the AUR SSH key from the `AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` secret, clones `ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/<pkg>.git` for both packages, bumps `pkgver`, regenerates `.SRCINFO` with `makepkg`, commits and pushes. `clara-bin` PKGBUILD comes from the repo (source of truth); `clara-git` PKGBUILD is updated directly in its AUR repo. Skips cleanly when nothing changed.
  - AppImage confirmed release-only: it is uploaded as the `appimage-package` CI artifact and attached to GitHub Releases with the other distro packages; `dist/` is gitignored and nothing is committed to the repo.

### 2026-10-16 04:35:00
- **ci(aur)**: release pipeline now ships a real pacman package
  - `package.yml` archlinux job packages with `makepkg` as a non-root builder using the shared `.github/aur/PKGBUILD.in` template, producing `clara-bin-<ver>-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` with proper `.PKGINFO`/`.MTREE` metadata as the release asset (previously a plain `clara-archlinux-*.tar.zst` DESTDIR tarball). `build-test.yml` now uses the same template instead of an inline heredoc.
  - `aur/clara-bin/PKGBUILD` now consumes the package asset via `bsdtar` extraction (excluding `.PKGINFO`/`.MTREE`) instead of copying a `usr/` tree from the plain tarball.
  - The archlinux release container installs the full runtime dependency list so the PKGBUILD dependency set is validated on every release build.

### 2026-10-16 04:20:00
- **ci(aur)**: build a real pacman package with makepkg in the test workflow
  - New `aur` choice for the `only` dispatch input plus a `build-aur` job: builds the source in an `archlinux:latest` container, then packages it with `makepkg` as a non-root user, producing `clara-bin-<ver>-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` with proper `.PKGINFO` and `.MTREE` metadata (instead of the plain DESTDIR tarball the `distros` job uploads). The job asserts both metadata entries exist and uploads the result as `aur-package`.
  - The build container installs the full AUR runtime dependency list, so the dependency set declared in the PKGBUILD is validated on every run.

### 2026-10-16 04:05:00
- **fix(build)**: stop relying on `which` for tool and interpreter detection
  - `source/Makefile.deps.mk` detected the PyQt6 UI tools with `$(shell which pyuic6)`. Minimal build containers (e.g. `fedora:latest`) do not ship `which`, so `PYUIC6` came out empty, `HAVE_FRONTEND` stayed false and the fedora rpm was built without the entire python frontend (no `clara` launcher, no desktop files, only `carla-single` + libs). Switched `PYRCC5`/`PYUIC5`/`PYUIC6` detection to `command -v`.
  - `data/carla*` launcher wrappers resolved the interpreter with `PYTHON=$(which python3)` and a broken `[ ! -f ${PYTHON} ]` check. On guests without `which` (e.g. minimal arch) `$PYTHON` expanded empty and the shell tried to exec the non-executable `/usr/share/carla/carla`, dying with `line 15: /usr/share/carla/carla: Permission denied`. Switched all nine wrappers to `command -v` + `[ -z "$PYTHON" ]`.

### 2026-10-16 03:40:00
- **fix(rpm)**: stop the fedora rpm from owning shared system directories
  - `.github/workflows/specs/clara.spec` used a catch-all `%files` of `/usr/*`, which made the package claim `/usr/bin`, `/usr/include`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/lib/lv2`, `/usr/lib/pkgconfig` and `/usr/share` as its own directories. On Fedora these belong to `filesystem`/`lv2`/`pkgconf`, so `dnf install clara-*.rpm` aborted with `file /usr/bin from install of clara-0.0.0-1.fc44.x86_64 conflicts with file from package filesystem-3.18-52.fc44.x86_64`.
  - Replaced the glob with the actual clara payload paths: `/usr/bin/*`, `/usr/include/carla`, `/usr/lib/carla`, `/usr/lib/lv2/carla.lv2`, `/usr/lib/pkgconfig/*`, `/usr/share/carla`.

### 2026-10-16 01:30:00
- **fix(ci)**: make the void-musl build actually link and fail loudly
  - The musl jobs set `LDFLAGS='-lfts $LDFLAGS'` with single quotes, so the literal `$LDFLAGS` was stored; make then expanded it as `$L` + `DFLAGS`, producing `ld: cannot find DFLAGS`. Changed to `LDFLAGS="-lfts $LDFLAGS"` in `build-test.yml`, `package.yml` and `package-aarch64.yml`.
  - The musl build hid failures (`docker ... sh -c` with no `set -e`, and `make | tee` masking make's exit code), so a broken build still uploaded a near-empty tarball as success. Added `set -e` and made `make`'s exit status propagate.
  - Added a `only` dispatch input to `build-test.yml` so a single component (e.g. `void-musl`) can be built and re-tested without running every job.

### 2026-10-16 00:45:00
- **fix(ci)**: build VST frontend stubs on every distro and make the rpm version legal
  - alpine/archlinux/fedora jobs now install the OpenGL + X11 development packages (`mesa-dev libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev`, `mesa libglvnd libx11 libxcursor libxext libxrandr`, `mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXcursor-devel libXext-devel libXrandr-devel`). `HAVE_DGL` requires `pkg-config --exists gl x11 xcursor xext xrandr`; without it the VST2 plugin stubs (`bin/CarlaRack*`, `bin/CarlaPatchbay*`) are never built and `make install` fails at `install_main`.
  - The test workflow's default version is now rpm-legal (`0.0.0`, no `-`), and the fedora job rewrites `-` to `.` before writing `Version:` in the spec (rpmbuild rejects `Version: 0.0.0-test`).

### 2026-10-16 01:00:00
- **ci(test)**: add `build-test.yml` workflow for downloadable test builds
  - New `workflow_dispatch`-only workflow that builds every platform (alpine, ubuntu, fedora, archlinux, void-glibc, void-musl, nix, appimage, flatpak) and uploads the resulting packages as run artifacts. It never publishes, tags, or attaches anything to a release, so builds can be verified and downloaded locally (`gh run download`) without touching release assets.
  - Adds a per-platform "Detect frontend tooling" step that reports `pyuic6`/`uic6` locations and the `HAVE_FRONTEND`/`HAVE_QT6`/`FRONTEND_TYPE` values from `make -pn` into the run summary, to diagnose the Fedora GUI-less packaging issue.
  - Version string is a dispatch input (`version`, default `0.0.0-test`); `fail-fast` disabled so a single distro failure does not cancel the others.

### 2026-10-16 00:20:00
- **fix(ci)**: correct multi-distro packaging (frontend tooling, versioning, naming)
  - Frontend tooling: install the PyQt6 UI tools the build needs (`pyuic6`, required for `HAVE_FRONTEND`). Ubuntu `.deb` and both AppImage jobs now install `pyqt6-dev-tools`; the void-glibc and void-musl jobs install `python3-pyqt6-devel-tools`; the Fedora spec adds `python3-pyqt6` to `BuildRequires`. Previously these jobs silently produced GUI-less packages (no launcher scripts, desktop files, icons or Python frontend).
  - Packaging: removed the `make install ... || cp -r bin` fallback from every distro and void-musl job, so the stray top-level `bin/` build output is never shipped again.
  - Versioning: `build-void-musl` now sets `VERSION` (it was producing `clara-void-musl-.tar.zst`), and the AppImage is named after the Clara release version (`Clara-<release>-<arch>.AppImage`, honoring a `CLARA_VERSION` override) instead of the engine `VERSION`.
  - `scripts/release_and_push_aur.sh` now normalizes the version argument (strips leading `v`/`V`, dots and whitespace, then validates `X.Y.Z`), preventing malformed tags such as `v.1.0.1`.

### 2026-10-15 23:55:00
- **chore(releases)**: retract all published binary artifacts
  - Removed every uploaded binary asset from the GitHub releases `v0.1.0`-`v1.0.1` (including the malformed `v.1.0.1`), keeping only the auto-generated source archives. All were broken: GUI-less deb/rpm/nix/void packages (missing launcher scripts, desktop files, icons and the Python frontend), a non-starting AppImage (no frontend bundled; hard-coded `/home/runner` build paths), an empty `void-musl` tarball, and `archlinux`/`alpine` tarballs that were plain install trees rather than real `pkg.tar.zst` packages (no `.PKGINFO`/`.MTREE`).
  - Each release body now carries a "RETRACTED - DO NOT USE" notice, and `releases.json` marks every documented release `retracted`. Corrected builds will be published after the packaging fixes land.

### 2026-10-15 23:30:00
- **refactor(frontend)**: replace the Qt-linked native dialogs with pure-PyQt6 implementations
  - `libcarla_frontend` (a Qt C++ shared library) is no longer built or shipped. Its three dialogs - About, Add JACK Application, and the Plugin List browser - are reimplemented in Python under `source/frontend/dialogs/` and `source/frontend/pluginlist/`, using the non-Qt `libcarla_utils` backend for plugin discovery.
  - `CarlaFrontendLib` (`carla_frontend.py`) is now a thin pure-Python shim that keeps the same public API, so `carla_host.py` is unchanged and the app no longer needs a system Qt matching the native build (this fixes the AppImage startup crash caused by the Qt ABI mismatch).
  - Makefile: stop building/installing `libcarla_frontend`, and install the new `dialogs`/`pluginlist` Python packages.

### 2026-10-15 22:40:00
- **perf(packaging)**: shrink the AppImage significantly
  - Switched the bundled `appimagetool` from AppImageKit (gzip squashfs) to the maintained `AppImage/appimagetool`, which defaults to **zstd**, and pinned `--comp zstd --mksquashfs-opt -Xcompression-level 19` (override with `APPIMAGE_ZSTD_LEVEL`).
  - Added a `trim_appdir` pass before packaging: deletes Python test/idlelib/tkinter/`ensurepip`/pip, `__pycache__`/`*.pyc`/`*.pyo`, PyQt6 `*.pyi` stubs, Qt `translations`/`qml`/`lib/cmake`/`lib/pkgconfig`/`lib/metatypes`, `*.a`/`*.la`/`*.prl`, and `include`/`man`/`doc`, then strips every ELF with `strip --strip-unneeded`.

### 2026-10-15 22:15:00
- **ci(packaging)**: Experimental aarch64 packaging workflow
  - New manual-only `.github/workflows/package-aarch64.yml` (`workflow_dispatch`). It builds the same target set as the release workflow (alpine/ubuntu/fedora/archlinux/void archives, AppImage, Flatpak, Nix) on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners and attaches the results - suffixed `-aarch64` so they never clobber the x86_64 assets - to the **same** versioned GitHub Release. Targets without an aarch64 image/build fail soft (`continue-on-error`).
  - `scripts/build_appimage.sh` now accepts `--arch=aarch64` (relocatable CPython + linuxdeploy/appimagetool from the aarch64 assets); `scripts/build_flatpak.sh` derives the output arch from `uname -m`.

### 2026-10-15 21:30:00
- **ci(packaging)**: AppImage & Flatpak release jobs + docs
  - `.github/workflows/package.yml` now builds a standalone x86_64 **AppImage** and a **Flatpak** bundle on every `v*` tag and ships them as release assets alongside the deb/rpm/tar.zst/nix packages. Both jobs are non-blocking (`continue-on-error`) so a bundle problem cannot block the rest of the release.
  - README + `installation.md` document the AppImage/Flatpak installs and the `clara` primary / `carla` backwards-compatible symlink naming.
  - Bumped Clara to **1.0.1**.

### 2026-10-15 20:30:00
- **chore(release)**: Clara 1.0.0 + portable packaging
  - Bumped the Clara application version to **1.0.0** (`CLARA_VERSION_STRING`, `aur/clara-bin/PKGBUILD`, `releases.json`).
  - New **Neo Candy** app icon (mixer glyph from the GPL-3.0 `neo-candy-icons` theme) replacing the legacy Carla bitmap/SVG set; rasterized to 16/32/48/128/256px.
  - New portable **AppImage** builder (`scripts/build_appimage.sh`) that bundles a relocatable CPython + PyQt6 (which ships its own Qt6) and the native libs for x86_64.
  - New **Flatpak** assets (`data/flatpak/…`) and builder (`scripts/build_flatpak.sh`).
  - New **git tag hook** (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-push` + `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`): pushing a `v*` tag builds the AppImage and Flatpak locally into `dist/`.
  - `clara` is the primary binary/desktop name; `carla` remains as a backwards-compatible symlink.

### 2026-10-15 19:30:00
- **ui(settings)**: Sidebar typography, Nerd Font icons & label fixes
  - Sidebar tab buttons now render a **Nerd Font glyph + label** (General, Patchbay, Engine, OSC, File Paths, Plugin Paths, Wine, Experimental) in the detected Nerd Font instead of the cleared legacy bitmap icons; the sidebar font family now follows that font (with a clean sans fallback).
  - Replaced the remaining **legacy bitmap button icons** (project-folder open, and the Add / Change / Remove buttons on File Paths and Plugin Paths) with Nerd Font glyphs.
  - Fixed the **overly long descriptive label overlapping itself**: word-wrapped help/note labels now enable `heightForWidth` and top-left alignment so the layout reserves the full wrapped height.
  - Hid two **legacy options** that are no longer worth exposing: "Full canvas repaints (slower, …)" and "Load Carla backend in global namespace (NOT RECOMMENDED)".

### 2026-10-15 18:45:00
- **ui(patchbay)**: Search interaction restyle + settings widget polish
  - Search **results dropdown** selection/hover is now Catppuccin blue (`#89b4fa`) instead of the harsh orange, with a slim themed scrollbar and **no horizontal scrollbar** (results elide to the right and use uniform item sizes).
  - The on-canvas **search match highlight** was retinted from orange to sapphire (`#74c7ec` for matches, `#89b4fa` for the active row) to match the rest of the theme.
  - Settings dialog: added consistent theming for **combo boxes** (including their dropdown popup view), **spin boxes**, **line edits**, **check boxes** and all **scrollbars**, so the settings widgets no longer fall back to the default (ugly, horizontally-scrolling) platform style.

### 2026-10-15 18:15:00
- **ui(settings)**: Settings dialog cleanup
  - Removed the leftover decorative glyphs in the **upper-right corner of every settings tab** (the old `label_10` / `label_icon_engine_5` / `label_31` / `label_19` header icons were not matched by the previous hide list, so they lingered).
  - Removed the legacy inline **info / warning 16px icons** next to the descriptive text across Engine, OSC, File Paths, Plugin Paths, Wine and Experimental tabs; the text they annotated is kept.
  - Hid the deprecated **"Fancy eye-candy"** option (its toggle handler is disabled upstream).
  - Long help / note lines now **word-wrap** and render in a muted secondary color instead of clipping into a single unreadable line.

### 2026-10-15 17:30:00
- **feat(patchbay)**: Animated signal / event flow + search moved into the top toolbar
  - **Search box relocated**: the patchbay search field is no longer a standalone floater; it now lives inside the top context toolbar as a rounded text box that stays anchored to the bar (and follows it when dragged). The results popup still drops down beneath it.
  - **Signal flow animation**: new `patchcanvas/signalflow.py` animator drives a travelling pulse along every cable and lights up active nodes, using **real engine levels** (input/output peak values polled per plugin). Each pulse has a comet tail for a clear sense of direction; active nodes get both a tinted border and a body glow whose intensity tracks loudness. Levels are smoothed with fast attack / slow decay, and the pulse is now overlaid even on router/orthogonal cables that custom-draw themselves.
  - **External / PipeWire levels**: new `patchcanvas/pwlevels.py` samples the real level of external nodes (virtual **BUS** sinks, monitors, hardware I/O, external clients) using the same hidden peak-detect tap as pavucontrol (`PA_STREAM_PEAK_DETECT` via `libpulse`, pumped on the GUI thread). Activity is keyed by canvas **group id**, and any node with no sample (e.g. a playback stream like Spotify) falls back to a slightly attenuated level borrowed from the groups it is wired to, so a fully external chain still pulses as long as one Carla plugin sits anywhere on it. Cables light up from **either** endpoint.
  - **Clean patchbay**: the observer taps (ours and third-party ones like `pavucontrol` / `pwvucontrol`) are recognised by name and filtered out of the canvas, so they never appear as nodes or in port selectors. Per-node capture can be toggled from the right-click menu of the flow button (setting `Canvas/SignalFlowExternal`, default on).
  - **Quick switch**: a new toggle button (`heartbeat` glyph) in the left canvas palette enables/disables the animation, restored from the new `Canvas/SignalFlow` setting between sessions.
  - **Cleanup**: removed the bottom-right `?` patchbay shortcuts button (its help text lives on the left-palette `btnHelp` tooltip).

### 2026-10-15 15:45:00
- **feat(patchbay)**: Search selection now persists
  - `Ctrl+F` fuzzy search now *selects* the matching nodes in the scene (in addition to the highlight), so the result set stays selected after the search box closes via Enter, click or Esc.
  - The selection persists until the user interacts with the canvas - a canvas click/drag, or the select-all / invert-selection / deselect-all shortcuts, clears it (`_clearHighlights`).
  - Because the persisted selection emits `pluginSelected`, it also drives the mini-rack sync and the floating context toolbar, so you can search and then immediately arrange / act on the result set.

### 2026-10-15 15:00:00
- **feat(canvas)**: Graph introspection model
  - New `patchcanvas/graph_info.py`: a single JSON-serialisable view of the patchbay (`collect_graph`) - nodes (id, name, split, pos/size/rect, ports with mode/type), connections (out/in group+port+node index) and derived topology (edges, incoming, degree, connected components, longest-path layers). Foundation for the layout plugins and the future claractl / scripting layer.

### 2026-10-15 14:00:00
- **feat(canvas)**: Pattern-aware heuristic auto-arrange
  - New `heuristic` arrange algorithm (`patchcanvas/arrange_heuristic.py`), labelled "Heuristic (pattern-aware)", registered after `sugiyama` and selectable from the Arrange Tools menu.
  - It detects connection topology instead of applying a single rule: splits the graph into connected components (islands), then per component recognises exclusive pairs (side by side), fan-out (source beside a vertical stack of destinations), merges (sources aligned before the sink), fully connected cliques (compact grid), stars / hub-and-spoke (sources left, hub centre, sinks right), and plain chains (following signal flow). Anything unrecognised falls back to a layered pass with barycenter crossing reduction.
  - Deterministic (ties broken by node name), reuses `_nodeGraph`/`syncNodePositions`, honours snap/grid, and leaves island separation gaps so unrelated groups do not overlap.

### 2026-10-15 13:00:00
- **perf(canvas)**: Fix multi-second freeze when applying canvas settings (pressing OK) while a pure-Python router (`router`/`orthogonal`) is the active line style.
  - `slot_configureCarla` tears down and rebuilds the whole patchbay, so every cable re-routes once; at ~50-80 ms per long cable that meant several seconds of UI block.
  - `linealgo_ortho.py`: rewrote `_astar` to a flat array-indexed state space (`index = (cell*4)|dir`, list-based `dist`/`prev`, no per-node dict/tuple allocation) and capped grid resolution (`_MAX_CELLS=72`) so cable length no longer dictates A* work. ~50-80 ms/line → ~5-10 ms/line.
  - `linealgo_router.py`: same resolution cap (`_MAX_CELLS=72`) in `plan_waypoints`. ~11-15 ms/line → ~6-8 ms/line.
  - Net effect: a ~50-cable patch drops from ~3-4 s to a few hundred ms on settings apply.

### 2026-10-15 12:00:00
- **feat(canvas)**: Orthogonal router, Sugiyama arrange
  - New `orthogonal` line algorithm (`patchcanvas/linealgo_ortho.py`): self-contained Manhattan router, a direction-aware A* over an occupancy grid with a bend-aware cost (`length + bend_penalty·turns + soft cable-proximity cost`), node boxes as hard obstacles, neighbouring cables as soft obstacles, and rounded corners. Registered after `router`.
  - New `sugiyama` arrange algorithm (`patchcanvas/arrange_sugiyama.py`): classic layered layout - cycle breaking, longest-path layering, barycenter crossing reduction (down/up sweeps), even column placement. It appears in the Arrange Tools "Auto arrange" submenu automatically via the arrange registry.
  - Settings "Line style" combo picks up `orthogonal` with no extra code.

### 2026-10-15 11:15:00
- **refactor(canvas)**: Pluggable arrange algorithms, self-contained router plugin, router fix
  - New `patchcanvas/arrangealgos.py` registry mirroring `linealgos.py`: a `LayoutAlgorithm` interface (`arrange(nodes)`), `register_layout_algorithm`/`get_layout_algorithm`/`layout_algorithms`/`resolve_layout_algorithm`. Two built-ins: `classic` (the original signal-flow `autoArrange()`, still used by the context menus) and `flow` (the newer columnar, selection-aware layout; the default). `patchcanvas.autoArrangeNodes(nodes, algorithm=None)` now dispatches through the registry.
  - Arrange choice is selectable from the **Arrange Tools** popover ("Auto arrange" submenu) and persisted as `Canvas/ArrangeStyle` (`CARLA_KEY_CANVAS_ARRANGE_STYLE`, read in `carla_host`, stored on the Python-side `options_t.arrange_style`).
  - The `router` A* + flocking implementation moved out of the shared `patchcanvas/routing/` package into a single self-contained plugin module `patchcanvas/linealgo_router.py` (grid + A* + string-pulling + flocking + `RouterLineAlgorithm`). It still consumes only the public `LineContext` API; the `routing/` package was removed.
- **fix(canvas)**: Smart router no longer draws straight through node boxes
  - The A* search produced a correct detour, but flocking relaxation then pulled the waypoints back through the obstacle (the unit test was too lenient). Relaxation now (a) only applies the smoothing force when both neighbours can see each other (line-of-sight via the occupancy grid), (b) hard-projects any waypoint out of an inflated node box, and (c) validates the final polyline and falls back to the raw A* path if it ever tunnels. Added a real-`QGraphicsScene` integration test asserting no waypoint or segment enters an inflated node rect.

### 2026-10-15 10:30:00
- **feat(canvas)**: Obstacle-aware routing API (A* + flocking) and smart arrange/wire tools
  - New `patchcanvas/routing/` package: `grid.py` (scene-space occupancy grid), `astar.py` (A* search + string-pulling simplify), `flock.py` (force-based waypoint relaxation for cable spacing), and a single public entry point `plan_waypoints(ctx, ...)`. It consumes only a `LineContext` (endpoints, `nodes()`, `siblings()`), never patchcanvas internals.
  - Registered a new `router` line algorithm (`Smart router (A* + flocking)`): routes cables around node boxes and spaces them from sibling cables, falling back to bézier on failure. Not the default; `bezier` remains default.
  - New public canvas API (exported from `patchcanvas`): `autoArrangeNodes()`, `autoWire()`, `autoArrangeAndWire()`, `autoRepelNodes()`. Arrange uses signal-flow column layering; wire chains nodes in topological order using compatible free ports and requests connections through the normal canvas callback; repel falls back to the whole canvas when nothing is selected.
  - Canvas context toolbar now exposes a grouped **Arrange Tools** popover (auto arrange / auto wire / arrange + wire / auto repel), replacing the separate arrange/repel buttons so the bar stays uncluttered. Wire/both are disabled with no selection.

### 2026-10-15 09:05:00
- **refactor(canvas)**: Retire adaptive, default to bézier
  - `adaptive` hybrid dispatcher removed from the registry; `bezier` is the default again (`CARLA_DEFAULT_CANVAS_LINE_STYLE`, `patchcanvas.options.line_style`). A future A* + flocking router will replace it.

### 2026-10-15 08:40:00
- **fix(canvas)**: Line styles collapsed to straight; tune adaptive hybrid
  - Every non-`bezier` style rendered as a straight line: the settings dialog writes the legacy `Canvas/UseBezierLines` flag as `False` for any non-bezier pick, and `resolve_line_algorithm()` treated that as "force straight". The `line_style` string is now authoritative and the legacy boolean is ignored (`linealgos.py`, `patchcanvas/__init__.py`).

### 2026-10-15 08:20:00
- **feat(canvas)**: New cable shapes + adaptive hybrid routing
  - Added a registered `circuit` line algorithm (H/V trace with rounded corners and sibling-based lane offsets).
  - Renderer flags renamed/clarified: `dynamic` (re-route all cables on node moves; `tracks_others` kept as a read alias) and `selection_sensitive` (re-route on selection change, coalesced per event-loop tick). Dynamic re-routes are coalesced in `CanvasBox.repaintLines` to at most once per event-loop tick.
  - New geometry helper `rounded_polyline` used by the circuit shape.

### 2026-10-15 07:05:00
- **refactor(canvas)**: Pluggable line-algorithm registry for patchbay cables
  - Connection shape logic was spread across `if/elif` chains in `canvasline.py`, the drag previews (`canvaslinemov.py` / `canvasbezierlinemov.py`), and the settings combo. New `patchcanvas/linealgos.py` introduces a `LineAlgorithm` interface (`build_path` / `build_drag_path`, plus `line_type`, `mov_line_type`, `cap_style`) with a registry (`register_line_algorithm`, `get_line_algorithm`, `line_algorithms`).
  - Algorithms receive a `LineContext` (endpoints + `direction` + the ports/connection/`canvas`), not bare points, so complex renderers are possible: `ctx.siblings()` yields every other cable for coupling/bundling, `ctx.nodes()` yields `(group_id, QRectF)` for node-avoidance routing, and `paint(painter, ctx, path)` plus `params()` are optional hooks. Setting `dynamic = True` makes the canvas re-route all cables on node moves so bundles stay in sync.
  - `BezierLineAlgorithm`, `StraightLineAlgorithm`, and `SteppedLineAlgorithm` are registered out of the box; adding a new shape is one class + `@register_line_algorithm` with zero branching changes elsewhere.
  - Drag previews are now a single registry-driven `CanvasLineMov`, so `stepped` gets a live preview too (previously only bezier/straight). Old `CanvasBezierLine` / `CanvasBezierLineMov` names remain as backward-compatible aliases.
  - The settings "Line style" combo is populated from the registry instead of a hardcoded list (`carla_settings.py`).

### 2026-10-15 06:11:30
- **fix(ui)**: Restore `Qt.Key_Backspace` (Qt6 compat)
  - `qt_compat` aliased most `Qt.Key_*` names to their Qt6 `Qt.Key.*` enum for bindings compatibility, but `Key_Backspace` was missing, so deleting a plugin with Backspace crashed with `AttributeError: type object 'Qt' has no attribute 'Key_Backspace'` (`carla_skin.py:1656`). Added the alias.

### 2026-10-15 06:02:45
- **chore(ui)**: Log the active patchbay viewport at startup
  - The canvas startup now logs whether the patchbay is `OpenGL` or `Software raster`, the viewport update mode, and the `Canvas/UseOpenGL` setting, so it is obvious from the terminal whether GPU rendering is actually active.

### 2026-10-15 05:41:20
- **perf(ui)**: Smoother canvas panning and further drag/repaint savings
  - Box drop-shadows are now also skipped while panning the canvas (not just during a node drag), so the strips exposed by scrolling are cheap to redraw.
  - The canvas view no longer adjusts update rects for antialiasing (`DontAdjustForAntialiasing`) and the viewport is marked opaque (`WA_OpaquePaintEvent`), keeping repaints smaller and skipping Qt's background erase.
  - The grid dots are now drawn in a single `drawPoints` call with a round-capped pen instead of thousands of individual `drawRect` calls.
  - The minimap no longer draws the canvas grid while rendering the scene to its cache (invisible at that scale), making minimap refreshes noticeably cheaper.

### 2026-10-15 05:26:10
- **fix(ui)**: Ask about Ctrl+C in the terminal, not with a GUI dialog
  - Pressing Ctrl+C now prints a plain prompt (`[K]ill` / `[T]ray + detach`) in the terminal where the key was pressed, instead of popping a `QMessageBox`.
  - Fixed the previous implementation crashing: `QMessageBox.YesRole`/`NoRole` don't exist on the class in this Qt build, and the failure fallback called `logger.warning()` with a single argument (the logger requires a tag plus message), so the prompt died with an `AttributeError`/`TypeError`.
  - The prompt is shown whenever Carla runs from a TTY; the tray/detach option is only offered when a system tray is available.

### 2026-10-15 05:24:03
- **perf(ui)**: Smoother patchbay node dragging
  - Box drop-shadows no longer recompute their blur on every drag frame: while a box is being dragged the shadow is skipped (the box is painted directly) and restored on release, removing the main source of drag lag.
  - Position changes are no longer written to settings and pushed to the engine on every drag frame; they are flushed once when the drag ends, avoiding a synchronous settings write plus engine callback per frame.
  - The grid background is now cached by the canvas view (`CacheBackground`) and painter state is not saved (`DontSavePainterState`), so the dotted grid is not repainted for every dot on each drag/pan frame.

### 2026-10-15 05:01:41
- **feat(ui)**: Prompt on Ctrl+C (SIGINT) instead of quitting immediately
  - SIGINT is now routed separately from SIGTERM: SIGTERM still closes immediately (needed by session managers/systemd), while SIGINT pops a dialog.
  - Dialog offers "Kill Carla" (default, `Y`/Enter) or "Tray + Detach" (default-less `N`), the latter minimising to the system tray and detaching from the controlling terminal (`setsid`, `SIGHUP` ignored, stdio redirected) so the app survives the terminal closing.
  - Only prompts when launched from a TTY with a system tray available; otherwise it closes as before.

### 2026-10-15 04:52:16
- **feat(ui)**: Edge auto-scroll when dragging the minimap view scope
  - Left-dragging the view scope to (or beyond) a minimap edge now continuously pans the minimap and the main patchbay canvas, ramping speed with how far past the edge the cursor is.
  - Auto-scroll stops automatically when the cursor returns inside the map or the view reaches the edge of the node bounds.

### 2026-10-15 04:46:41
- **fix(ui)**: Minimap phantom node, bottom-scope clamping and collapse button
  - Phantom node: hidden / not-yet-portable group boxes (created at `(0,0)`) were being outlined because `scene.items()` includes invisible items; the minimap and scene-rect expansion now skip invisible items.
  - View scope could not be panned to the bottom until manually scrolling: scene/view rect expansion only ran once at setup (before plugins loaded). It now also runs from `updateMiniCanvasLater()` (client add/remove/rename) and updates both the scene and the view scene rect.
  - Collapse button did nothing: `QToolButton.clicked` passes a bool check-state into `toggleCollapsed(collapsed)`, making every click evaluate as "no change"; the connection is now wrapped so it toggles.

### 2026-10-15 04:31:06
- **feat(ui)**: Blender-style minimap overlay, discoverability and persistence
  - Replaced the top `✕` bar with a compact grip (drag to move) and a corner collapse tab; hide/expand and zoom-reset moved into a right-click context menu.
  - Added a zoom-level badge (`FIT` / percentage) and an on-map control hint so wheel-zoom, middle-drag pan and double-click reset are discoverable.
  - Minimap now expands the patchbay scene rect to the union of node bounds (+margin) so the bottom of the canvas can actually be panned to at startup.
  - Reduced early misplacement: placement now waits for valid geometry and re-clamps via deferred repositioning.
  - Persisted `Minimap/X`, `Minimap/Y`, `Minimap/Zoom`, `Minimap/Collapsed` and `Minimap/Visible` in `QSafeSettings` (app-wide), restored at startup and saved on drag/collapse/zoom/hide and on settings save.

### 2026-10-15 04:14:49
- **fix(ui)**: Render modern minimap from the live scene with contrast-corrected node outlines
  - Replaced the hand-drawn bounding-box fill with a real `QGraphicsScene` render, matching the classic minimap so node bodies, headers, ports and cables keep their true appearance.
  - Outlined every node using its own custom color (theme color when uncolored), passing it through a WCAG luminance/contrast check that lightens or darkens the color against the background so all nodes stay visible.
  - Added minimap-internal zoom (mouse wheel, cursor-anchored), middle-drag panning, and double-click reset so large patches stay readable.

### 2026-10-15 03:09:23
- **feat(ui)**: Float minimap into hideable patchbay viewport overlay
  - Reparented `miniCanvasPreview` out of the side dock into a rounded overlay anchored at the bottom-right of the patchbay viewport.
  - Placement is mode-aware: Modern UI mode uses the floating overlay, while Classic mode restores the original sidebar minimap.
  - Added hide (`✕`) and restore (`Map`) controls so the minimap can be dismissed and brought back on demand.
  - Kept existing canvas navigation and theming behavior intact while repositioning on viewport resize.

### 2026-10-15 00:00:00
- **feat(ui)**: Add "Minimize to system tray" option
  - Added `Main/MinimizeToTray` setting (default off) in Settings with load/save/reset.
  - Main window minimizes to a system tray icon with Show/Quit menu and restores on activation.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-10-13

  - Implemented crisp, color-coded category pill badges (e.g. `SYNTH`, `FX`, `EQ`, `DYN`, `UTIL`) inside patchbay node headers for instant visual classification without cluttering or tinting the whole node.

- **fix(color)**: Properly reset patchbay node color to default category tone when rack item color is reset
  - Updated `changePluginColor()` in `carla_host.py` to restore the node's Catppuccin category color when resetting a rack item rather than leaving it in an unsynced state.
  - Updated `getColorAndSkinStyle()` and `createPluginSlot()` in `carla_skin.py` to cleanly revert to the category palette whenever `CarlaColor` is reset to `"255;255;255"`.

- **feat(patchbay)**: Support individual color customization and persistence for non-rack patchbay items
  - Enabled color selection and persistence for all patchbay items (e.g. ALSA, JACK, PipeWire hardware, external clients) via canvas positions metadata in `patchcanvas.py` and `project_storage.py`.
  - Serialized custom node colors into project files (`.carxp`, `.carjp`, `.json`) under canvas group position tags.

  - Aligned rack context menu structure by elevating Color submenu to the top level, matching canvas node context menus with direct `QColorDialog` triggers.
  - Synchronized colors directly from rack widgets (`fSkinColor`) to patchbay canvas nodes on both `PluginListItem.recreateWidget()` and `slot_handlePatchbayClientAddedCallback()`.

- **fix(canvas)**: Preserve active selection on canvas right-click and add Select menu to node context menu
