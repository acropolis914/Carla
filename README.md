> ### Early Alpha — Action Required: Report Bugs & Join Development
> **Clara is evolving rapidly.** While the audio engine, routing graph, and autosaving core are rock-solid, expect UI quirks and experimental behaviors in the patchbay toolbars.
> - **Report Every Bug**: If you encounter crashes, graphical glitches, or broken controls, you **must [open a bug report](https://github.com/acropolis914/Clara/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)** with complete logs and system specs.
> - **Help Build Clara**: We need developers, audio hackers, and maintainers. **[Read CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and start contributing today.**
> - **Support the Developer**: A dollar goes a long way. I am a student working on my free hours to do this. My allowance doesn't really cut it and it is deeply appreciated if you would support through [**GitHub Sponsors**](https://github.com/sponsors/acropolis914) or [**PayPal**](https://paypal.me/paulharveysuarnaba). Thank you so much!

## About Clara

**Clara** (*Carla Improved*) is an enhanced fork of [Carla](https://github.com/falkTX/Carla) by [falkTX](https://github.com/falkTX). It modernizes modular audio routing on Linux by delivering fluid canvas navigation, automatic session preservation, deep dual-view integration, and high-DPI visuals designed for audio engineers and electronic music performers.

> [!NOTE]
> **Early Alpha Status**: Clara is in active, rapid development. Core audio routing, plugin hosting, session autosaving, and everyday workflows are fully functional and ready for daily use. Feedback and bug reports are welcome!

---

## Why Clara?

**First, credit where it is due:** [Carla](https://github.com/falkTX/Carla) is the OG: a rock-solid, battle-tested modular plugin host by [falkTX](https://github.com/falkTX) that has powered Linux audio for years. Clara does not replace that engine; it stands on Carla's shoulders, and everything you rely on (plugin hosting, drivers, stability) is still Carla underneath.

Clara is a **frontend-first reinterpretation** of that foundation, focused on **visuals and quality-of-life**. The engine is kept up to date with upstream, while the experience around it was reworked: the plugin scanner and loader got a pass, alongside general optimizations, some cleanup, and **OpenGL enabled by default** to drive the animations.

The goal is simple: an **eye-candy patchbay that asks for fewer clicks**.

- **Arrange & align**: auto-arrange, arrange in rows, multi-select with align, auto-repel when nodes overlap, and line nodes up before or after each other.
- **Less clicking in the graph**: direct bypass and switch buttons on the patchbay node, plus hiding I/O ports that are not in use.
- **Make it yours**: toggleable rounded node corners and a toggleable split-screen view (patchbay beside the rack, in lockstep).

If you already know Carla, Clara should feel familiar in all the right places and fresh everywhere you look.

## The Modern Modular Experience

Carla's rock-solid audio backend, supercharged with modern creative-suite ergonomics, intelligent graph layouts, and clean visual polish:
<img src="resources/screenshots/gradient_cables.png?raw=true&v=2" alt="Clara Patchbay & Rack Screenshot" width="880" style="border-radius: 8px;" />
- **Real-Time Color Sync & Gradient Cables**
  - One-click Catppuccin palette or custom color wheel: changing a color on any node **instantly syncs** across the canvas box, its rack module, and all connected cables.
  - Connection cables render as **smooth directional linear gradients**, seamlessly interpolating from the source node's accent into the destination node's tone.
- **Clean, Focused & Contemporary Aesthetic**
  - Stripped of retro clutter: enjoy **4x MSAA hardware acceleration**, rounded card geometry, high-contrast category badges (`SYNTH`, `FX`, `HW`, `IN`/`OUT`), and crystal-clear hinted typography.
  - Floating context-aware icon toolbars keep controls within reach while leaving your graph completely unobstructed.
- **Creative-Suite Selection & Navigation**
  - **Photoshop & Blender Muscle Memory**: `Space` or `H` to glide across your infinite canvas, `V` for precise interaction, and `Q` for rubberband marquee.
  - **Directional Marquee Selection**: Drag left-to-right to select touched nodes; drag right-to-left for strict bounding box enclosure.
  - **Pro Selection Shortcuts**: `Ctrl+A` (Select All), `Ctrl+D` (Deselect All), and `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Invert Selection).
  - **`Ctrl+F` Fuzzy Search**: Instantly spotlight and camera-jump to any plugin or port in seconds across complex multi-client setups.
- **Smart Auto-Arrange & Collision-Free Alignment**
  - Effortless cleanup: automatically untangle sprawling routing webs with **repel-aware auto-arrange** that respects node boundaries and prevents overlapping collisions.
  - Align selected nodes horizontally or vertically with uniform spacing at the click of a button.
- **Dual-View Power: Patchbay + Rack in Lockstep**
  - Graph routing meets knob tweaking: view the modular patchbay alongside the mini rack in a seamless side-by-side split.
  - **Bidirectional Focus Lock**: Clicking any node in the patchbay instantly scrolls and focuses its rack panel, and vice versa.
- **Zero-Anxiety Session Preservation**
  - Background rotating autosaves (`.autosaves/`), modified dirty indicators (`*`), live status countdown timers, and safe-exit verification dialogs ensure you never lose a creative take.
- **Live Dynamic Customization (Zero Restarts)**
  - Tailor Clara to your display on the fly with live responsive sliders for rack margins, slot padding, and layout width.

## Key Features

### Modern Patchbay Canvas & Navigation
- **Photoshop/Blender Modal Tools**: Instant hotkeys (`V` Select/Move, `H`/`Space` Pan, `Q` Marquee) with a floating tool overlay.
- **Canvas Node Quick Search (`Ctrl+F`)**: Fuzzy search bar that automatically filters, highlights, and centers viewport onto target nodes.
- **Selection Ergonomics**: Industry-standard shortcuts (`Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+D`, `Ctrl+Shift+I`) and multi-selection preservation across context menus.
- **Fluid & Crisp Rendering**: Native 4x MSAA multisampling on OpenGL viewports with subpixel integer hinting for ultra-sharp port labels.

### Vibrant Theming & Cable Routing
- **Unified Catppuccin Colors**: Automatic color-coding by audio role (`SYNTH`, `FX`, `EQ`, `DYN`, `UTIL`, `SOURCE`, `SINK`, `HW`).
- **Dynamic Cable Gradients**: Connection cables smoothly interpolate source and destination node colors via linear gradients.
- **Configurable Cable Formulas**: Choose between organic Bezier curves, straight/linear diagonals, or orthogonal right-angle routing.

### Side-by-Side Dual-View Workflow
- **Rack & Graph Synchronization**: Split dual-pane combining modular routing with parameter tweaking.
- **Bidirectional Focus**: Clicking any patchbay node instantly scrolls and highlights its corresponding rack module, and vice versa.

### Session Safety & Fault Tolerance
- **Automatic Rotating Autosaves**: Background rotating backups (`.autosaves/`) with recursive directory guard.
- **Dirty State Tracking**: Real-time modified indicator (`*`) and status bar countdown timer until the next autosave snapshot.
- **Safe Exit Protection**: Confirmation prompt (`Save`, `Discard`, `Cancel`) when closing modified sessions.

### Rich Console Logging & Live UI Tweaks
- **Structured Python Rich Console**: Color-coded loglevels and categorical tags (`APP`, `ENGINE`, `PATCHBAY`, `BACKEND`) with low-level C++ `stderr` interception.
- **Instant Reactive Settings**: Real-time sliders for rack spacing, padding, and width without application restarts.

### Modern CLI Experience
- **Rich Startup Banner**: Launching from a terminal renders a `rich` panel reading `Clara vX.Y.Z` then `based on Carla version A.B.C`, alongside the runtime and binary/resource paths; `--version` shows the same banner.
- **Graceful Ctrl+C Handling**: The terminal SIGINT prompt is a `rich` panel where pressing `Enter` quits (default) and `T` keeps Clara running in the system tray.
